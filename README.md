### Description

Update of my scripting engine

Now supports if/elseif/else, while loops, loop loops, arrays of variables, formula evaluation (i got the code from here, but cant remember from who, but ill find and give them credit, i promise, sorry to that person). All of the above can be nested, along with the functions.

You can EASILY add very little code to make it open a console window and do input and output. I didn't add that because it's purely an engine so far.
