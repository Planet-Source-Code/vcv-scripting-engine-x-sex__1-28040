It's a scripting engine made in visual basic.  It's only in Alpha Stages right now, but is still pretty cool for only being about half done after a week of working on in.  There is an example script right when you load it up which you can try and study the code, and try to write your own.  Only a few built in functions right now, and minimal support for loops/if statements.  There is a loop, and if/elseif/else statement, but they are very cheap right now...although they CAN be nested.  Also you can write your own aliases, and call them, as seen in the example.
